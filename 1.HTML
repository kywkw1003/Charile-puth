  <p>No, this is not goodbye
  I swear that I'm gonna change
  No, baby, please don't cry
  It doesn't have to end this way</p>
  <img src="hello.jpg" width="300px">

  <p>'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
  I get terrified
  Please don't say goodbye</p>


  <p>'Cause girl, <strong>if you leave me now</strong>
  If you give it up and just walk right out
  You will take the biggest part of me
  And <u>all the things that I believe</u>
  Baby, if you leave me now (yeah)</p>


  <p>When did we lose our way?
  My whole world was unravelling
  And girls driving me insane
  There's no road for the travelling</p>


  <p>When I think about all of the nights you're gone
  (Nights you're gone, oh)
  I get terrified (I get terrified)
  Please don't say goodbye (Bye)</p>


  <p>'Cause girl, if you leave me now
  If you give it up and just walk right out (oh)
  You will take the biggest part of me
  And all the things that I believe
  Baby, if you leave me now
  Oh, baby, if you leave me now</p>


  <p>Oh, I can promise if we parted (parted)
  And if you left me brokenhearted
  Every single night
  I'll think about you with someone else
  Baby, if you leave me</p>


  <p>Baby, if you leave me now
  If you give it up and just walk right out (oh)
  You will take the biggest part of me
  And all the things that I believe
  Baby if you leave me now
  Oh girl, if you leave me now
  If you give it up and just walk right out (oh)
  You will take the biggest part of me
  And all the things that I believe
  Baby, if you leave me now
  Oh, baby, if you leave me now</p>
